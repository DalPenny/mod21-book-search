  ## Description
  This app is a google books search engine that uses a GRAPHQL API queries built with and communicates with the Apollo Server. it can be used to search for books and a user can, after creating an account, login in and search for a book, as well as save a book and delete their saved books. I refactored it to use GRAPHQL with an apollo server on the backend, as well as a Mongodb database. it is a MERN stack app and uses a REACT js front end, and express js and node.js server and API tools.
